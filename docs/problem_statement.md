Problem Statement: Current [redacted proprietary] JDE inventory alert system generates 12,400 aging alerts weekly across network, with internal analysis revealing 78.3% false-positive rate, causing planning teams to spend 1.5 hours daily reviewing non-actionable alerts and resulting in $4.1M annual liquidation losses from missed true-positive alerts buried in noise, 28% planner turnover attributed to alert fatigue, 35% reduction in alert response speed over the past 12 months, and $89K quarterly in excess labor costs for alert review processes. Root cause analysis provided by Operations Leadership identifies legacy system treating 1.2M+ SKUs uniformly regardless of seasonal profiles, no velocity-based differentiation across 847 active product categories, static alert thresholds across all 32 fulfillment centers despite varying capacity utilization (68%-94%), and ignored cross-facility replenishment opportunities in aging calculations. CEO mandate: Design intelligent suppression mechanism maintaining >95% true-positive detection while eliminating operational waste and restoring planner confidence in alert ecosystem.
